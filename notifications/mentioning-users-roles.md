# Mentioning Users and Roles

First, make sure you have developer mode turned on. You can enable it under Settings -> Appearance.

## How to mention a User?

1. Right-click the desired user in your server's member list and select "Copy ID".
2. Under the Streamcord dashboard, add or edit a notification. Under the message section, paste the ID in the desired spot. Then, add `<@` before the role ID, and `>` after. \
   For example, if your user ID is `375805687529209857`, the end result should look like `<@375805687529209857>`.
