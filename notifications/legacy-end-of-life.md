# Legacy End of Life

This page outlines the timeline for the deprecation and end-of-life cycle for [Legacy](legacy/) notifications.

## Background

Since its conception, [Spyglass](spyglass/) has been intended to replace Legacy notifications as the backend for Streamcord's notification system. Spyglass contains many improvements over Legacy (which are outlined on Spyglass's [documentation page](spyglass/)) and overall is a more ideal system for both users (that's you) and Streamcord as a whole.

Because of this, there will be a transition period while we finalize the switch from Legacy to Spyglass, and to allow users to report bugs and potentially find any other issues. While Spyglass has undergone intensive internal testing and private beta phases with Partners and Pro subscribers, we still want the switchover to be as smooth as possible.

Before the final deprecation date for Legacy, you will be able to [manually transfer your notifications](spyglass/transfer-notifications-to-spyglass.md) over to Spyglass. After that, we will start to incrementally transfer over a percentage of Legacy notifications until all the notifications have been transferred, at which point Legacy will reach EOL (End of Life) and be gone forever.
