# Deprecated Features

## Audio commands

The `/audio` commands were deprecated on January 12th, 2022 and will be removed on January 26th. This is due to low reliability and bugs between Lavaplayer and Twitch, causing a poor user experience.

## `/clips trending` command

The `/clips trending` command was deprecated on January 12th, 2022 and will be removed on January 26th. This is due to an inconsistency between the old (v5) and new (v7) Twitch API versions, where the functionality that the `/clips trending` command relies on to function has been discontinued.&#x20;
