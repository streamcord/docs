# Getting Started

## Add Streamcord to your server

{% hint style="info" %}
You can invite Streamcord to any server that you have the **Manage Server** permission in.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to [dash.streamcord.io](https://dash.streamcord.io).
2. You should see a prompt from Discord asking you if you want to allow Streamcord to see your username and servers. Click **Authorize**.
3. Click on your server name in the list.
4. You should see another Discord prompt, this time asking you to add a bot to a server.
   * Select your server name in the dropdown, and click **Continue**.
   * Choose the permissions that you want to give Streamcord. Click **Authorize**.

## Basic commands

To view Streamcord's help menu, just type`/help` using the slash command system in the server you've invited the bot to.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
If Streamcord's slash commands are not displayed in the server, follow the steps outlined in this guide: [https://docs.streamcord.io/troubleshooting-slash-commands](https://docs.streamcord.io/troubleshooting-slash-commands)
{% endhint %}

If you've set up the proper permissions, you'll be sent a message just like this one:

![Streamcord Help Command](<.gitbook/assets/image (45).png>)

From here, you can get links to our website, dashboard, and other relevant sites.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**Note:** If you see an empty message from Streamcord, you've most likely turned off embeds in your Discord settings. From your Discord app, go to User Settings > Text & Images and turn on "Show website preview info from links pasted into chat."
{% endhint %}

Type `/` to view a list of slash commands. This will give you a list of everything that you can do with Streamcord. You can also view the commands list from [this page](commands/).
