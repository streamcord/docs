# What does Pro offer?

Streamcord Pro is Streamcord's premium subscription service. While Streamcord's core features, such as notifications and Live Role, will always be free, you can receive extra benefits and small features by subscribing to Streamcord Pro. Purchasing Pro also supports development costs and helps keep Streamcord free for everyone.

## What do I get with Pro?

Pro users receive extra customization features, as well as a dedicated bot, and some other perks. To view the full list of Pro benefits, please visit [https://streamcord.io/twitch/pro](https://streamcord.io/twitch/pro) on our main website.

Both monthly and yearly plans are available, with a 15% discount if you subscribe for an entire year. Pro starts at $2.50/month (plus VAT if applicable), which costs less than 4 chicken nuggets from McDonald's.

## How are subscriptions handled?

Payments are handled exclusively through [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/devakira). This means that subscriptions are all handled by them, and you will never have to share bank or credit card info with Streamcord directly. Patreon also offers comprehensive support and tools for us that make it easier to give you the easiest experience possible.
