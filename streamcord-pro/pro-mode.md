# Pro Mode

### What is Pro Mode and what does it do?

Pro mode is a dashboard feature that lets you change which bot is used for a server.

When Pro mode is _disabled_, the dashboard will use the main bot (Streamcord) for notifications and live role.

However, when Pro mode is _enabled_, the Pro-Bot (Streamcord Pro) will be used for notifications and live role.

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;**Note:** Streamcord Pro is a completely separate bot and requires another invitation. You can invite the Pro-Bot from [https://link.streamcord.io/pro\_invite](https://link.streamcord.io/pro\_invite).

**If you haven't subscribed to Pro, you will not be able to use the Pro bot on your server.**
{% endhint %}

When you tick the checkbox labelled "Enable Pro mode" on your server's dashboard page, the following will happen:

1. The server will be able to use Streamcord Pro's commands
2. Notifications and Live Role configurations will be transferred from the main bot to the Pro bot.

Please note that Streamcord Pro is required to use Pro mode on your server. Check out [Streamcord Pro](https://streamcord.io/twitch/pro) on our main website for more details.
