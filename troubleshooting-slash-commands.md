# Troubleshooting Slash Commands

#### **1. Allow the bot to show slash commands in your server.**

Visit [https://link.streamcord.io/invite](https://link.streamcord.io/invite) and choose your server from the list, then press "Authorize".

You _**don't** need to kick the bot_ in order to do this step.

#### &#x20;**2. Make sure you have enabled the "Use Application Commands" permission.**

* Go to your server's settings.
* Go to the roles tab.
* Choose the "@everyone" role at the bottom of the list.
* Scroll down to the "Text Channel Permissions" section and enable the "Use Application Commands" toggle.&#x20;

#### **3. Restart your Discord app.**

#### **4. Update your Discord app to the latest version.**

* On desktop: Completely quit out of Discord by going to the taskbar, right-clicking the Discord icon, and clicking "Quit Discord".
* On mobile: Go to the app store that you downloaded Discord with and check if there is a button to update the app.

#### **5. Enable the setting to show slash commands on your app.**

You may have disabled the setting to show rich text previews in the text box for your Discord client.

* Go to the User Settings screen on your app.
  * On desktop: This is the gear/cog icon next to your username in the bottom-left corner.
  * On mobile: Swipe left to get to the channel/server menu, and click on your profile picture in the bottom-right.
* Go to the "Text & Images" tab.
* Toggle the "Use slash commands and preview emojis, mentions, and markdown syntax as you type" setting so that it is enabled.
